# Importing all libraries required in this notebook
import pandas as pd

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Reading data from remote link
url = "http://bit.ly/w-data"
s_data = pd.read_csv(url)
print("Data imported successfully")

s_data.head(10)


# Let's plot our data points on 2-D graph to eyeball our dataset and see if we can manually find any relationship between the data. We can create the plot with the following script:

# In[ ]:


# Plotting the distribution of scores
s_data.plot(x='Hours', y='Scores', style='o')  
plt.title('Hours vs Percentage')  
plt.xlabel('Hours Studied')  
plt.ylabel('Percentage Score')  
plt.show()


# **From the graph above, we can clearly see that there is a positive linear relation between the number of hours studied and percentage of score.**

# ### **Preparing the data**
# 
# The next step is to divide the data into "attributes" (inputs) and "labels" (outputs).

# In[ ]:


X = s_data.iloc[:, :-1].values  
y = s_data.iloc[:, 1].values  


# Now that we have our attributes and labels, the next step is to split this data into training and test sets. We'll do this by using Scikit-Learn's built-in train_test_split() method:

# In[ ]:


from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split  
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, 
                            test_size=0.2, random_state=0) 


# ### **Training the Algorithm**
# We have split our data into training and testing sets, and now is finally the time to train our algorithm. 

# In[ ]:


from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression  
regressor = LinearRegression()  
regressor.fit(X_train, y_train) 

print("Training complete.")


# In[ ]:


# Plotting the regression line
line = regressor.coef_*X+regressor.intercept_

# Plotting for the test data
plt.scatter(X, y)
plt.plot(X, line);
plt.show()


# ### **Making Predictions**
# Now that we have trained our algorithm, it's time to make some predictions.

# In[ ]:


print(X_test) # Testing data - In Hours
y_pred = regressor.predict(X_test) # Predicting the scores


# In[ ]:


# Comparing Actual vs Predicted
df = pd.DataFrame({'Actual': y_test, 'Predicted': y_pred})  
df 


# In[ ]:


# You can also test with your own data
hours = 9.25
own_pred = regressor.predict(hours)
print("No of Hours = {}".format(hours))
print("Predicted Score = {}".format(own_pred[0]))


# ### **Evaluating the model**
# 
# The final step is to evaluate the performance of algorithm. This step is particularly important to compare how well different algorithms perform on a particular dataset. For simplicity here, we have chosen the mean square error. There are many such metrics.

# In[ ]:


from sklearn import metrics  
print('Mean Absolute Error:', 
      metrics.mean_absolute_error(y_test, y_pred))
